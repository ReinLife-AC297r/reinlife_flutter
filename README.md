# reinlife

frontend of ReinLife

ReinLife is an cross-platform open source mobile Health app and research platform.

The backend is written in Python (Flask) and can be found at XXX.

## Current version of development tools
Should be found in pubspec.yaml. I(Boer) am using Flutter 3.15.0, Java16, cocoapod 1.13.0, and Android Studio 17.0.6. 

## A quick start guide
The codes can be found in lib directory. The main file is main.dart. I(Boer) am using Android Studio to compile and run the code. 

I am using the default Android Emulator "Pixel_3a_API_34_extension_level_7_x86_64" as my target test device during development. It is also expected to work on other devices and platforms.
